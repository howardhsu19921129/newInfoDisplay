This is a  new version for FLH panel

I m trying to make a version that can be customize easily.

This is how I will do:

    1. create a main page with normal and defult display style.
    2. define the customize area. (maybe the logo part, or the colors, or title...etc.)
    3. create a invisible button that can enter the customizeing page.
    4. the customizeing page should include some upload feature and also description. (also return & reboot button.)
    5. so the customize stuff can be done in local.
